# ActionScript 3.0 Type Mismatch: Number vs. int

This example demonstrates a common ActionScript 3.0 type mismatch error that occurs when passing a Number to a function expecting an int. Although ActionScript offers implicit type conversion, it fails when the Number contains a decimal component.  The solution involves explicit type conversion or function parameter adjustments.
